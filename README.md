# Infracost CircleCI with GitHub Demo

See [this pull request](https://github.com/infracost/circleci-demo/pull/3) for the demo.

The [Infracost CircleCI Orb](https://github.com/infracost/infracost-orb) runs [Infracost](https://infracost.io) against pull requests. It automatically adds a pull request comment showing the cost estimate difference for the planned state if a configurable percentage threshold is crossed.

See the [Infracost integrations](https://www.infracost.io/docs/integrations/cicd) page for other integrations.
